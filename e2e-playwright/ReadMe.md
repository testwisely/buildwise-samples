$ npm init playwright@latest

Getting started with writing end-to-end tests with Playwright:
Initializing project in '.'
âœ” Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript? Â· JavaScript
âœ” Where to put your end-to-end tests? Â· tests
âœ” Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (y/N) Â· false
âœ” Install Playwright browsers (can be done manually via 'npx playwright install')? (Y/n) Â· true


âœ” Success! Created a Playwright Test project at /Users/zhimin/work/projects/buildwise-samples/e2e-playwright

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npx playwright test
    Runs the end-to-end tests.

  npx playwright test --ui
    Starts the interactive UI mode.

  npx playwright test --project=chromium
    Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

  npx playwright test example
    Runs the tests in a specific file.

  npx playwright test --debug
    Runs the tests in debug mode.

  npx playwright codegen
    Auto generate tests with Codegen.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

    npx playwright test

And check out the following files:
  - ./tests/example.spec.js - Example end-to-end test
  - ./tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.js - Demo Todo App end-to-end tests
  - ./playwright.config.js - Playwright Test configuration
